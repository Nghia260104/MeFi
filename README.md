Welcome to MeFi!
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment).

## Step 1:

When first pull the project to your personal workspace, please make sure that you have done the set up and then run

```bash
# using npm
npm install
```
Then install the dependencies for the app (I will update later!)

## Step 2: 

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
npx react-native start
```

After the Metro Bundler run, press 
```bash
a
```
to run the android application

### For iOS (try not to do this!!)

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
