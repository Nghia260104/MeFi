# Welcome to MeFi

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
Link UI: [Mefi](<https://www.figma.com/design/INpo5899LHXfMBEpHP5Mm5/MEMO-(Copy)?node-id=105-1053&t=PX8zWoGqXYfEWmvn-1>) - Password: Mefi-123456

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment).

### Step 1

When first pull the project to your personal workspace, please make sure that you have done the set up and then run

```bash
# using npm
npm install
```

Then link the custom font to your app using

```bash
npx react-native-asset
```

Then install the dependencies for the app

### react-native-swiper

```bash
#install @react-native-swiper

```

Documentation: <https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper>

### react-native/bottom-tabs

```bash
#install @react-native/bottom-tabs
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
```

Documentation: <https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/>

### lottie-react-native

```bash
#install lottie-react-native
npm install lottie-react-native
```

### @react-native-picker/picker

```bash
#install @react-native-picker/picker
npm install @react-native-picker/picker
```

#### MongoDB

```bash
# install driver for mongodb
npm install mongodb --save
```

#### Dependencies for MongoDB, Backend and api between front-end and back-end

```bash
npm install mongoose express cors axios react-native-dotenv jsonwebtoken bcrypt @react-native-google-signin/google-signin jwt-decode --save
```

#### Redux for global state management

```bash
npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk @reduxjs/toolkit --save
```

#### Async Storage for keeps user logged in

```bash
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage --save
```

#### redux-persist

```bash
npm install redux-persist
```

#### Nodemailer for verification register code

```bash
npm install nodemailer googleapis @googleapis/docs --save
```

If you want code suggestions for nodejs modules, you can install @types/<modules_name> (Remember to check their installation first)

```bash
npm install --save @types/express # For express
# Do not install @types/mongoose because it has already included its own types in the package
```

If there are any other needed dependencies, I will add later!

### Step 2

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

If that doesn't work try

```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

#### For iOS (try not to do this!!)

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
